## How to Use X Force Netfabb 2019 64 Bit
  
Now that you have downloaded and installed X Force Netfabb 2019 64 bit for free, you might be wondering how to use it. In this section, we will give you a brief overview of the main features and functions of the software and how to access them.
  
### Importing and Editing 3D Models
  
One of the first things you will need to do is to import your 3D model into the software. You can do this by clicking on the "File" menu and selecting "Import". You can choose from various file formats, such as STL, OBJ, STEP, IGES, 3MF and more. Once you have imported your 3D model, you can view it in the workspace and use the tools on the left panel to edit it. You can rotate, scale, move, mirror, align and transform your 3D model as you wish. You can also use the tools on the right panel to repair and optimize your 3D model. You can fix holes, gaps, overlaps, inverted normals and other errors that might affect the printability of your 3D model. You can also reduce the polygon count, smooth the surface, hollow the model and add labels and text.
  
### Slicing and Preparing for Printing
  
Once you have edited your 3D model, you can slice it and prepare it for printing. You can do this by clicking on the "Prepare" tab at the top of the screen. You can choose from various printing technologies, such as FDM, SLA, SLS, DLP and more. You can also select your printer model from a list of supported printers or create your own custom printer profile. You can then adjust the printing parameters, such as layer height, infill density, support structure and more. You can also use the tools on the left panel to nest multiple models on the build plate, optimize the orientation and position of the models and add manual supports if needed. You can preview the sliced model in the workspace and see how it will look like when printed. You can also estimate the printing time and material usage.
